# PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS I - üñ•Ô∏è
## Blinking The Out Board Leds Practice üí°

  - In this practice I did the modularization code for UART communication and Timers library.
  - You need to call the SetUp function and aplly the delay time(Milliseconds).
  - WARNING: Make sure about the circuit, if you do a shorting will be dangerous.
  - PS: I tried to use others Timer's, but the only one that worked was the TIMER7, I checked the frequency in a digital oscilloscope at university.
  - PS: WatchDog Disabled.
