## Checking the GPIO Frequency Using BBB Timers and Making a Menu Using UART Communication ‚è∞

  - In this practice I did the modularization code for UART communication and Timers library.
  - You need to call the SetUp function and aplly the delay time(Milliseconds).
  - I checked the led frequency in a digital oscilloscope at university.
    - I made it for receive 3 integers numbers only, like 99 < ms < 1000, you can change if you want.
    - To do, send the binary and reset the BBB for another attempt.
  - WARNING: Make sure about the circuit, if you do a shorting will be dangerous.
  - PS: I tried to use others Timer's, but the only one that worked was the TIMER7.
  - PS: WatchDog Disabled.
