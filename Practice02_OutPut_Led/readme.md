## Blinking The Out Board Leds Practice üí°

  - Like the last practice, we need to define the Base Address and Offset, in this case, try to do this practice with other GPIO.
  - We need to take the offset pins and do the bitwise code. In this case, 4 leds out board will blink 0 until 15.
  - WARNING: Make sure about the circuit, if you do a shorting will be dangerous.
  - PS: WatchDog Enabled.
