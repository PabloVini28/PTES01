- Handling **GPIOs** (both input and output) for controlling and reading digital signals
- Configuring and utilizing **Timers** for creating delays, time tracking, and event scheduling
- Implementing **UART** communication for serial data transfer between devices
- Managing **Interrupts** to handle asynchronous events efficiently in real-time applications
