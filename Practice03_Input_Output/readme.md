## Blinking The Out Board Leds Practice üí°

  - Like the last practice, we need to define the Base Address and Offset, in this case we will use 2 buttons and 4 leds.
  - In this practice, I did the code modularization and it was more easy to do the Bare Metal app configuration. It was like coding on the Arduino. (Maybe I will be crucified for that kkkkkkkkk).
  - WARNING: Make sure about the circuit, if you do a shorting will be dangerous.
  - PS: WatchDog Disabled.
